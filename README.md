# Browser Doom

Doom, Heretix, Hexen and Strife for browsers

Browser Doom is a port of Chocolate Doom for web browsers. While this port primarily focuses on a port of Doom that is compiled to web assembly, most of the Chocolate Doom code is retained even when not used by the browser port. So when building on a desktop target, the result should be what is more or less Chocolate Doom.
